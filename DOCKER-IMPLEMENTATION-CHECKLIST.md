# Docker Implementation Checklist

This checklist tracks the implementation progress for Step 12: Create Docker-based Development Environment from the implementation plan.

## Created Files

- [ ] `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage Dockerfile for development and production
- [ ] `docker-compose.yml` - Main development environment
- [ ] `docker-compose.test.yml` - Testing environment
- [ ] `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production environment
- [ ] `docker-compose.advanced.yml` - Advanced development setup with additional services
- [ ] `.dockerignore` - Excludes unnecessary files from Docker context
- [ ] `scripts/docker.sh` - Utility script for Docker operations
- [ ] `scripts/setup-docker-env.sh` - Setup script for Docker environment
- [ ] `scripts/make-executable.sh` - Makes all scripts executable
- [ ] `scripts/create-directory-structure.sh` - Creates directory structure
- [ ] `docker/nginx/default.conf` - Nginx configuration for Docker environment
- [ ] `docker/healthcheck.sh` - Health check script for Docker containers
- [ ] `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` - VS Code dev container configuration
- [ ] `.env.example` - Example environment variables file
- [ ] `docs/guides/docker-production-deployment.md` - Production deployment guide

## Setup Steps

1. Create directory structure:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/create-directory-structure.sh
   ```

2. Make scripts executable:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/make-executable.sh
   ```

3. Set up Docker environment:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-docker-env.sh
   ```

4. Start development environment:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/docker.sh dev
   ```

## Integration with Existing Code

- The Docker setup is designed to work with the existing project structure
- No code changes are needed; the Docker environment adapts to the current codebase
- The Docker configurations use environment variables to adjust settings

## Testing Docker Setup

1. Test development environment:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/docker.sh dev
   ```
   - Visit http://localhost:5001 to verify the API is running
   - Visit http://localhost:5001/docs to verify API documentation
   - Make a code change to verify hot-reloading

2. Test test environment:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/docker.sh test
   ```
   - Verify tests run successfully in the Docker environment

3. Test production environment:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/docker.sh prod
   ```
   - Verify the API runs in production mode

## Documentation Updates

- [ ] Added Docker section to main README.md
- [ ] Created Docker Production Deployment Guide
- [ ] Added Docker Development Environment documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Local Testing**: Test the Docker implementation locally to ensure it works as expected
2. **Development Workflow**: Test development workflow with Docker to identify any issues
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Consider integrating Docker with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, etc.)
4. **Container Registry**: Set up a container registry for storing production images
5. **Monitoring**: Implement container monitoring for production deployments
